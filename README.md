# Lilas-Quest
Lila's Quest is a small game I made with a friend for a computer science class. It is a 2D platformer featuring Lila, who is travelling through a forest filled with monsters in order to take back all of the hats that were stolen from her.

## Controls
- Press A and D to move Lila left and right.
- Press S to crouch.
