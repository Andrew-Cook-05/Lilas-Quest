# Lila's Quest
This is a game that I created with a friend for a computer science class. You play as Lila, and are tasked with exploring a mysterious forest collecting several different hats along the way. There is a tutorial in-game to teach you how to play.

## Music
All music was written by me in FL Studio. If you want to listen to any of the songs, you can find them in the links below:
